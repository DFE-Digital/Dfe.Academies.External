		We have developed the ‘apply to become an academy’ service to be accessible and easy to use for everyone. We have aimed to achieve and maintain to the
		<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">
			Worldwide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG.2.1)
		</a> Level AA standard.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Department for Education is committed to making its digital services accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have tested the service cross multiple browsers and devices –

			check you’ve installed the latest updates to your browser
		</a> to get the best user experience.
	</p>
	<p>
		DfE’s accessibility lead fully accessibility tested the service in September 2019. They used the software Jaws 2018, SuperNova v18, Zoomtext 2019 and Dragon NaturallySpeaking V15.4.
	</p>

	<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Dragon NaturallySpeaking</h1>
	<p>
		We have found that Dragon users will need to employ the dictation box when filling in the text boxes into form fields to use the application effectively. Users should also be familiar with MouseGrid.
